To make this engine, you will need these dependencies:
    - Boost (recent stable release)
    - CMake (recent stable release)
    - Ogre3D (recent stable release)
    - OIS (recent stable release)
    - Bullet (recent stable release)
    - MyGUI (recent stable release)
    - SFML (recent clone from upstream git)

In general, we always try to keep up close with upstream and thus the newest
version will always work.

Then just do the usual:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
